# # Optimization Essentials <a class="anchor" id="parameter-fitting-optimization-essentials"></a>

# ## Definitions

# **Optimization** is the term used by mathematicians to find the *best* value of a function.
# There are two kinds of "best" - the minimum value and the maximum value.
# Actually, the two are equivalent.
# This is because finding the maximum value is easily translated into finding the minimum value by searching for the negative of the maximum value.
# 
# More formally, we use $f$ to denote a function of many variables.
# We denote the $n$-th variable by $x_n$, and so
# $f(x_1, \cdots, x_N)$ produces a scalar result given $N$ values.
# Here is some useful notation:
# * ${\bf x} = (x_1 , \cdots, x_N)$
# * $x_n$ is a parameter
# * $N$ is the number of parameters to fit
# * ${\bf x}^{\star}$ is the vector that minimizes
# $f({\bf x})$ for all permitted values of ${\bf x}$
# 
# To expand on the last point, in reaction networks, species concentrations
# and kinetic constants must be non-negative.
# 
# Here's an example of an $f$ in the $x$-$y$ plane:
# $f(x, y) = \sqrt{ (x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2)}$.
# The input to $f$ is a point in the plane;
# the output of $f$ is the distance from that point
# to $(1, 2)$.
# In this case, $f$ is always non-negative, and so it's
# minimum value is 0.

xstar = 10
ystar = 20
x = np.arange(-50, 50, 0.5)
y = np.arange(-50, 50, 0.5)
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(x, y)
xx = xx.flatten()
yy = yy.flatten()
df = pd.DataFrame({"x": xx.flatten(), "y": yy.flatten()})
df = df.apply(lambda v: np.round(v, 0))
df["distance"] = ((df["x"] - xstar)**2 + (df["y"] - ystar)**2)**0.5

# In the following examples, we mostly use $N = 1$ since the visualizations are easier.
# But keep in mind that almost always $N$ is much larger than 1 since $N$ is the number of parameters we want to fit.
# 
# Many times

# ## Convex Curves

# A convex function of ${\bf x}$ looks like a bowl.
# That is, if you repeatedly change ${\bf x}$ so that $f$
# gets smaller, you are guaranted to find ${\bf x}^{\star}$.

# In[ ]:

_ = plt.plot(xv, 3 + (xv - 4)**2 )
_ = plt.title("Convex Curve")


# This function is convex. We can readily see that the minimum value of this function occurs at $x^{\star} = 4$.
# A convex curve has the very nice property
# that its local minimum is also the global minimum.
# That is, there are no small valleys where the optimizer might get "stuck".
# For this reason, it's easy to find $x^{\star}$ using gradient decent.

# ## Non-Convex Curves

# Unfortunately, convex curves are rare in practice. Much more common is something like the following.

# For curves such as these, hueristic methods are needed such as differential evolution, simulated annealing, and random stochastic
# gradient descent.

# # Programming to find minimum values

# Here, we describe how to use the python ``scipy.minimize`` library to find the minimum value of a function.
# 
# First, you need to implement $f({\bf x})$.
# We implement the distance function in the plane

# Next, we use the ``LinearConstraint`` class in ``scipy.optimize`` to indicate that we are only intereted in points in the upper right quadrant. This isn't essential for the example we're doing now. But it is very useful later on when we want to ensure that kinetic constants are non-negative. 
# 
# The constraints are defined in terms of bounds after a matrix multiplication.
# Let ${\bf M}$ be the constraint matrix with dimension $N \times N$, ${\bf x}$ be a solution vector.
# Note that $({\bf M})  ({\bf x})$ is also a vector of dimension $N$.
# The constraints are that each element in $({\bf M}) ({\bf x})$
# must be greater equal to its corresponding element in
# ${\bf x}^L$ and less than or equal to its corresponding element
# in ${\bf x}^U$, where the superscripts $L$, $U$ indicate the lower and upper bound vector.
# 
# In the example below,
# $ {\bf M} = \begin{pmatrix}
# 1 & 0 \\
# 0 & 1 \\
# \end{pmatrix}$;
# ${\bf x}^L = [0, 0]$; and
# ${\bf x}^U = [\infty, \infty]$.
# So, the constraints are that $0 \leq x_n \leq \infty$.

# # Exercise

# Apply ``scipy.optimize.minimize`` to the ``LINEARY_PATHWAY_MODEL`` to find values of the parameters ``k1, k2, k3, k4`` that minimize the sum of squares of the residuals for ``LINEAR_PATHWAY_DF``.
# 
# *Hint*: Create a function that takes as input the values of the parameters of ``LINEAR_PATHWAY_MODEL`` and outputs the sum of squares of the residuals.
