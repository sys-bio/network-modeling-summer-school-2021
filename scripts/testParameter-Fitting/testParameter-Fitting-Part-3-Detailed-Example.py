# # Running SBstoat

# ``SBstoat`` is a python package intended to simplify the programmatic aspects of fitting. The package provides handles the programming details
# of the interactions between the optimization codes (``lmfit``) and ``tellurium`` simulations.
# 
# The required inputs to ``SBstoat`` are:
# - the model for which parameter values are being estimated;
# - observational data; and
# - specification of the parameters, their value ranges, and initial values.
# 
# For the linear pathway model, we ``LINEAR_PATHWAY_MODEL`` and ``LINEAR_PATHWAY_DF`` for the model and data, respectively.
# The description of the paarameters is done using a python dictionary, as shown below.

# In[ ]:


# Name, minimal value, initial value, and maximum value of each parameter
LINEAR_PATHWAY_PARAMETERS = [
    SBstoat.Parameter("k1", lower=1, value=50, upper=100),
    SBstoat.Parameter("k2", lower=1, value=50, upper=100),
    SBstoat.Parameter("k3", lower=1, value=50, upper=100),
    SBstoat.Parameter("k4", lower=1, value=50, upper=100),
]


# The python class ``ModelFitter`` does fitting for ``SBstoat``. Details of using this can be found below.

# In[ ]:




# In[ ]:


fitter = ModelFitter(LINEAR_PATHWAY_MODEL, 
                     NamedTimeseries(dataframe=LINEAR_PATHWAY_DF), 
                     parametersToFit=LINEAR_PATHWAY_PARAMETERS)
fitter.fitModel()


# ``SBstoat`` provides a textual report of the results of the fit.

# In[ ]:


print(fitter.reportFit())


# The report is in three sections.
# 
# The first section contains measures of the fit quality. The most commonly used measures are chi-square and reduced chai-square.
# We want both of these to be "small", although small is relative.
# These measures are most useful when comparing different fit results.
# 
# The "Variables" section gives parameter estimates. We se that the estimates obtained are fairly close to
# the true values in the original models.
# 
# The final section provides information about the relationships between parameter estimates. This can be useful
# in models where the structure of the model makes it difficult to separate one parameter from another.
# In these cases, there will be a large correlation between parameter (absolute) parameter values.

# ``SBstoat`` provides many plots to aid in understanding the fitting results.
# You can see these by typing in a Jupyter code cell ``fitter.pl`` and then pressing the tab key.
# Arguably the most useful is ``plotFitAll``, which, for each floating species (column in observed data), plots the fitted and observed values.
# This is shown below.

# In[ ]:


fitter.plotFitAll(figsize=(20, 5), numCol=5, color=["red", "blue"], titlePosition=(0.5, 1.05))


# These fits seem to be quite consistent with the observed data, with the possible exception of ``S5``.
# In the latter case, there is considerable variability that likely makes a good fit more difficult.

# In[ ]:


# See the options for plotFitAll


# If you are interested in a more complete analysis of the residuals, use ``plotResidualsAll``.

fitter.plotResidualsAll(figsize=(20, 10))


# # Workflow for fitting the Linear Pathway Model

# Although ``SBstoat`` eliminates the burden of programming details, fitting is often complex.
# This is because of the complexity of the fitting surface, as illustrated earlier in this chaper.
# This section illustrates how to use ``SBstoat`` to explore complex fitting surfaces.
# 
# ``SBstoat`` allows you to explore fitting along three dimensions.
# 1. **Fitting surface**. The fitting surface changes based on the following:
#   a. the selection of float species (columns in the observed data) that we attempt to fit;
#   b. the time span we fit over
# 1. **Optimization Algorithms**. As we noted previously, gradient descent is fast, but it only works well for convex fitting surfaces. We might want to try both gradient descent and differential evolution to see which works best for our model. Also, some optimization algorithms are stochastic, and so the search strategy may also choose to run
# the same algorithm multiple times. Finally, it may be desirable to do multiple optimizations in succession, using the results of the $n-1$-st to be the starting point for the $n$-th.
# 1. **Search start & scope**. This refers to the initial values of parameter values and the range of parameter values that are explored.

# 
# In the following explorations of the above dimensions of parameter fitting, we use the above workflow that consists of:
# 1. Select a subset of the observed data based on a specified time span (in this case, just ending time)
# 1. Construct a fitter for the linear pathway, observed data, columns to consider in fitting, the fitting methods, and parameter ranges/initial values.
# 1. Fit the model.
# 1. Print the fitting report.
# 1. Plot observed and fitted values.
# 
# This workflow is encapsulated in the the function ``doFit``.
# The arguments of the function have default that reproduce the
# results in the previous section.

# ## Fitting Surface

# We begin by exploring the effect of the fitting surface.
# 
# We can control the fitting surface in two ways. The first is by the selection of columns that are matched with observational data.
# 
# For example, suppose that we only consider ``S5`` and so the fitting surface is residuals
# from fitting ``S5``.

# In[ ]:


doFit(selectedColumns=["S5"])


# We see that we get poor estimates for most of the parameters, something that we can check because we know the true values of the parameters (``k1=1``, ``k2=2``, ``k3=3``, ``k4=4``).

# Another consideration is to focus on a subset of the dynamics. Below, we only consider through 2 seconds.

# In[ ]:


doFit(endTime=2)


# This improved the quality of the fit. We see this visually in the above plots and also in the significant reduction in chi-square. A lot of this improvement
# is a result of not inluding regions of high variability in observed values for ``S5``.

# ## Optimization Algorithms

# The main consideration here is the choice of optimization algorithms.
# Any valid ``method`` for ``lmfit`` can be used, and multiple methods can be used in combination. We illustrate this below.

# In[ ]:


# Fit with Levenberg-Marquardt 
doFit(fitterMethods=["leastsq"])


# In[ ]:


# Fit with differential evolution
doFit(fitterMethods=["differential_evolution"])


# In[ ]:


# Fit with differential evolution and then Levenberg-Marquardt 
doFit(fitterMethods=["differential_evolution", "leastsq"])


# For this model, we see that Levenberg-Marquardt works better than differential evolution, and doing the two in combination offers no benefit.

# ## Search Start & Scope

# Where we start the search and how far we search depends on the ranges of parameter values and the specification of initial values.
# This is specified by the ``parameterDct`` argument to ``ModelFitter``. This argument defaults to ``LINEAR_PATHWAY_PARAMETER_DCT``.

# If we create a bad parameter range, then we get very poor fits. Below, we start the search with a negative value for each parameter.
# Note that the observed values appear to be constant because of the large scale of the fitted values.

# # Exercise

# This exercise is about fitting parameters in the Wolf model for glycolytic oscillations.
# The model is ``WOLF_MODEL`` and the observational data for this model are ``WOLF_DF``.
# 
# 1. Implement a ``doFit`` function that encapsulates the workflow for the Wolf model.
# 1. Try fitting the model using ``WOLF_PARAMETERS``. First try ``leastSquares`` (a graident descent method) and then ``differential_evolution``. How did the two methods differ as to fitting time and quality? Why? What would you try next to get better fits?
# 1. Limit the parameter values so that the upper value is twice the true value. Try fits using leastsqs and differential evolution.
