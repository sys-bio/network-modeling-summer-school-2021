# # Motivating Example

# Dynamic testing is about verifying the output produced by a simulation.
# 
# This is illustrated at the beginning of the chapter using the example
# of a linear pathway consisting of three species ``S1``, ``S2``, and ``S3``. That is, ``S1`` $\rightarrow$ ``S2`` $\rightarrow$ ``S3``, with ``S1`` initialized to 10. 
# 
# We showed that the following outcomes were expected from the simulation:
# 
# - **O1**: ``S1`` decreases monotonically from 10 to 0.
# - **O2**: ``S2`` increases initially, peaks, and then declises to 0.
# - **O3**: ``S3`` increases monotonically to 10. 
# 

# Let's consider an initial implementation that contains an error due to a typo in the kinetics law.

# # Testing Expected Outcomes

# The expected outcomes are the starting point for constructing verification tests.
# Implementing these tests requires two Boolean helper functions.
# A Boolean function returns either ``True`` or ``False``.
# The first helper function, ``isMonotone``, takes as input a list or array of values and
# the direction expected (+1 for monotone increasing and -1 for monotone decreasing).
# The function returns ``True`` if the data are monotone in the desired direction.

# ``isMonotone`` allows us to check the conditions O1 and O3. For O2, we need to check that the values initially increase,

# decreasing.

# # Test Infrastructure

# Now that we have a way to test the outcomes, we need to write codes that use these tests.
# Fortunately, python provides a convenient way to do this with its ``unittest`` infrastructure.
# Using the infrastructure requires the following:
# - Copy the test template. The template consists of:
#   - ``import unittest``
#   - ``class TestModel(unittest.TestCase)``
# - Write a setUp function within ``TestModel`` that loads the model and gets simulation data.
# - Write tests that check the appropriate values in the simulation output.
# 
# This is done below for the linear pathway.
# Note that the code expects that the variable ``MODEL`` is the antimony codes for the model being tested. We see that there
# is a separate test for each column.

# These codes ran the 3 tests. All three passed for ``CORRECT_MODEL``. Now consider what happens with the model in ``INCORRECT_MODEL`` that fails on the test for ``S2``.

# We have demonstrated these tests in the Jupyter notebook. However, in practice, the tests would be in
# a separate python modeule (a file ending in ``.py``). Ideally, these test files are run whenever there is a
# change to the model or its supporting code.
# Systems such as ``github`` provide a way to run these tests automatically whenever the model changes, a process referred to
# as *continuous integration*.

# # Exercise

# This exercise uses the Wolf model of glycolytic oscillations.
# 
# 1. What is the relationship between the concentrations of
# glucose, furctose_1_6_bisphosphate, and pyruvate after the initial transients.
# Does this relationship always hold?
# 
# 1. Propose a test that checks for that the order of the concentrations at steady state of glucose, furctose_1_6_bisphosphate, and pyruvate.
# Hint: Implement a function that checks that one vector
# is greater than a second vector after a specified index.
# 
# 1. Another characteristic of the Wolf model is the presence of oscillations at the same frequency.
# Describe in words how you would implement a test to
# checks for the presence of these oscillations.
