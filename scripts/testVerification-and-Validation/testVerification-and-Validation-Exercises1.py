# # Exercise 1: Mass Balance Errors
# 1. Use SBMLLint to find mass check for mass balance errors in the Wolf model.
# 
# 1. Reaction ``J9`` implies that ``ATP`` and ``ADP`` have the same mass, which is clearly false since they differ
# by an inorganic phosphate.
# Revise the Wolf model to explicitly include
# inorganic phosphate and check your revised model
# with SBMLLint.
# Do you get the same dynamics with the revised model
# as with the original Wolf model?

# ## (1) Check for mass balance
# We begin by checking if the Wolf model has any stoichiometric inconsistencies.
# First, we create the antimony model as a string.

# # Exercise 2: Dynamic Tests

# This exercise uses the Wolf model of glycolytic oscillations.
# 
# 1. What is the relationship between the concentrations of
# glucose, furctose_1_6_bisphosphate, and pyruvate after the initial transients.
# Does this relationship always hold?
# 
# 1. Propose a test that checks for that the order of the concentrations at steady state of glucose, furctose_1_6_bisphosphate, and pyruvate.
# Hint: Implement a function that checks that one vector
# is greater than a second vector after a specified index.
# 
# 1. Another characteristic of the Wolf model is the presence of oscillations at the same frequency.
# Describe in words how you would implement a test to
# checks for the presence of these oscillations.

# ## (1) Relationships between concentrations

# After the initial transient, the concentration of
# pyruvate is almost always larger than the concentration of furctose_1_6_bisphosphate which is almost always larger than glucose.
# 
# The ordinal relationship holds a large fraction of the time but not *all* of the time.
# The plots below show this.

# ## (3) Frequency Tests

# After the initial transient of about 2 sec, concentrations oscillate. One way to characterize oscillations is by using the fourier transform. To construct tests, we could implement the function ``getFft`` that calculates the fast fourier transform
# (FFT) for a chemical species, and a second function, ``isOscillate``, that checks to calls ``getFft`` to determine if oscillations of the expected frequency are present.
